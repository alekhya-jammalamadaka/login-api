# TBD File: Login Endpoint API

## Overview

This TBD document outlines the design and implementation details of a small login and registration endpoint API. The API will provide functionality for user authentication and session management.

## Goals

- Create a simple and secure login system.
- Allow users to authenticate using credentials (username/email and password).
- Allows a new user registration
- Implement token-based session management for authenticated users.
- Ensure proper error handling and response formats.

## Endpoints

### 1. POST /login

#### Description

This endpoint handles user authentication.

#### Request Body

- `username` (string): The email of the user.
- `password` (string): The password for authentication > 6 letters.

#### Response

- `200 OK`: Successful login. Returns a JWT token for authentication.
- `400 Bad Request`: Invalid request parameters.
- `401 Unauthorized`: Incorrect username/email or password.

### 2. POST /logout

#### Description

This endpoint handles user logout.

#### Headers

- `Authorization`: JWT token obtained during login.

#### Response

- `200 OK`: Successful logout.
- `401 Unauthorized`: Invalid or expired JWT token.

### 1. POST /register

#### Description

This endpoint handles user registration.

#### Request Body

- `username` (string): The email of the user.
- `fullname` (string): The full name of the user.
- `password` (string): The password for authentication > 6 letters.

#### Response

- `200 OK`: Successful login. Returns a JWT token for authentication.
- `400 Bad Request`: Invalid request parameters.
- `401 Unauthorized`: Incorrect username/email or password.


## Authentication

The API will use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication. Upon successful login, a JWT token will be generated and sent to the client. This token should be included in subsequent requests as a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header.

## Error Handling

The API will handle errors gracefully and return appropriate HTTP status codes along with meaningful error messages in the response body.

## Security Considerations

- Passwords will be securely hashed and stored in the database.
- Use HTTPS to ensure data confidentiality during transmission.
- Implement rate limiting and other security measures to prevent brute force attacks.

## Future Improvements

- Implement password reset functionality.
- Add support for multi-factor authentication.
- Enhance logging and monitoring capabilities for security auditing.
- Enabling role authorization

## Conclusion

This TBD file outlines the design and implementation details of a small login endpoint API. The API provides basic authentication and session management functionalities while prioritizing security and simplicity.

## Database
- using a mongodb database model that is locally stored along with the api
